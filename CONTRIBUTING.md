# Contributing to MCP Server Filesystem

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MCP Server Filesystem! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Basic understanding of Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/redf0x1/mcp-server-filesystem.git
cd mcp-server-filesystem
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Test the server:**
```bash
npm start
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use ES modules (import/export)
- Follow existing code formatting
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Testing
- Test your changes with a real MCP client
- Ensure all existing functionality still works
- Add demo files to `workspace/` if needed for testing new features

### Security Considerations
- All file operations must respect allowed directories
- Validate all inputs using Zod schemas
- Use atomic operations for file writes
- Never expose sensitive system information

## üìù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
1. Check existing issues first
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Your environment (OS, Node.js version, MCP client)

### Suggesting Features
1. Open an issue with the "enhancement" label
2. Describe the feature and its use case
3. Explain how it would benefit users
4. Consider backward compatibility

### Submitting Changes

1. **Create a feature branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes:**
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Commit your changes:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add awesome new feature

- Detailed description of what was added
- Why this change was needed
- Any breaking changes or special notes"
```

4. **Push and create a pull request:**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Commit Message Guidelines
We follow conventional commits:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or modifying tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

## üéØ Areas for Contribution

### High Priority
- Performance optimizations for large directories
- Additional file operation tools
- Better error messages and debugging
- Cross-platform compatibility improvements

### Medium Priority
- Additional glob pattern features
